### important note by Francesco Staccone:
Please note that from 6th may I have changed my local Git username, due to some problems I had with the synchronization of local username and GitHub username. To be more clear, I had to change that because I was committing as "francescostaccone" while my GitHub username was actually "fstaccone", so that I was present neither as a contributor in the folder nor in the statistics made by GitHub. Currently I am present both in the contributors and in the statistics, but my preovious 63 commits (made with "francescostaccone") are not visible there. If you want to check them, they are located in the global list of commits.
